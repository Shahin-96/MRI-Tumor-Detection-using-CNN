# MRI Tumor Detector

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed and created a CNN model. The dataset consisted of 253 real brain MRI images, 155 with tumors and 98 without tumors. I utilized PyTorch's neural network module (nn.Module) and a DataLoader for better data handling. The result of the model's first evaluation was not promising, with an accuracy of 38 percent. However, I trained the model with the Adam optimizer, using 400 epochs and a learning rate of 0.0001. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 100 percent.
